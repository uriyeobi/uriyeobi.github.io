Hi! I'm **Joongyeub**, currently a Machine Learning Scientist at [Infima Technologies](https://infima.io). 

I grew up in South Korea and previously studied at [Seoul National University](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en) and at [Stanford](https://icme.stanford.edu). I've been working at a bank and startups, doing quantitative research and data science. My recent interests are broadly in applied AI and fintech.

This place is to share my experiments with models and data, and some thoughts on various things around me. 

You can find me at:
